# 🛡️ Offense–Defense Tools

Welcome to my security research & development playground — a collection of **offensive** (red team, adversary emulation) and **defensive** (blue team, detection/response) tools.  
The focus: **realistic attack simulation**, **threat detection**, and **automation with Python & C++**.
